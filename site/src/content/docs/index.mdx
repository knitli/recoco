import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Pure Rust" icon="rocket">
		A pure Rust fork of CocoIndex with no Python dependencies. Published to crates.io as `recoco`.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Feature Gated" icon="puzzle">
		Modular architecture. Bring only what you need: `source-postgres`, `target-qdrant`, `function-embed`, etc.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Incremental Dataflow" icon="random">
		Tracks data lineage. When source data changes, only affected downstream computations are re-executed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Persistent or Transient" icon="document">
		Run in-memory for quick tasks or backed by a database for long-running, stateful pipelines.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

Add `recoco` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
recoco = { version = "0.2", features = ["function-split", "source-postgres"] }
```
